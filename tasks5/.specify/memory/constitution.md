# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Clarity and Simplicity
Code must be easy to read, understand, and maintain. Avoid unnecessary complexity by adhering to established design patterns and ensuring that all code is well-documented. Simplicity is prioritized to reduce cognitive load and improve long-term maintainability.

### II. Code Quality
All code must meet high-quality standards. This includes adherence to style guides, consistent formatting, and the elimination of technical debt. Code reviews are mandatory to ensure quality and identify potential improvements.

### III. Testing Standards
Testing is non-negotiable. All features must include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests where applicable. The "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle is strictly enforced to ensure robust and reliable code.

### IV. User Experience Consistency
User-facing features must provide a consistent and intuitive experience. This includes maintaining uniform design patterns, predictable interactions, and accessibility compliance. User feedback must be incorporated iteratively to refine the experience.

## Additional Constraints

### Technology Stack and Compliance
The project must adhere to the approved technology stack. Any deviations require documented justification and approval. Compliance with relevant security and performance standards is mandatory.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review and Quality Gates
All code changes must pass through a rigorous review process. This includes verifying adherence to principles, passing all tests, and meeting defined quality gates. Deployment approvals require sign-off from designated maintainers.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with the principles outlined in this document. Complexity must be justified, and decisions must align with the project's core values.
