# CTA PKMS Tool Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must adhere to established quality standards, including maintainability, readability, and adherence to coding conventions. Code reviews are mandatory to ensure compliance with these standards.

### II. Code Clarity
Code must be self-explanatory and well-documented. Variable names, function names, and comments should clearly convey intent. Avoid unnecessary complexity and prioritize simplicity.

### III. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Testing is mandatory for all code. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests must be implemented to ensure functionality and reliability. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced.

### IV. User Experience Consistency
All user-facing features must provide a consistent and intuitive experience. Adhere to design guidelines and ensure accessibility for all users. Regular user feedback must inform improvements.

## Additional Constraints

### Technology Stack
The project must use approved technologies to ensure compatibility, security, and maintainability. Any deviation requires documented justification and approval.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Process
All code changes must undergo peer review. Reviews must verify compliance with the principles outlined in this constitution. Automated checks for quality and testing coverage are required.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with the principles. Complexity must be justified, and decisions must align with the project's goals.
